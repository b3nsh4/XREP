i have below 2 lists and my expected output. if target [0] and target [1] (adjacent fruits) then simply name
both as FRUITS. keep on doing the same. if adjacent are not FRUITS, just simply leave as it is..

`fruits = ['apple','orange','grapes','mango','pineapple']`

`target = ['orange','mango','CAR','apple','pineapple','BUS','apple']`

expected_output: `['FRUITS','CAR','FRUITS','BUS','apple']`

i wrote a solution

```z=0
while (z<len(target)):
      if (target[z] in fruits) and (z+1<len(x)) and (target[z+1] in fruits):
        new_list.append("FRUITS") #replaces with FRUITS 
        z+=1
      else:
        new_list.append(target[z]) #if not fruits, replaces as it is
      z+=1```

another solution is to make adjacent 2 values into a pair(tuple) and ask this tuple is in fruits.
but how can we make couple of 2 pairs eg: ('apple','orange') and WHAT IF WE HAVE ODD NUMBER OF ELEMENTS?
it is easier to make such pair of 2 tuples with even number of values, when odd ,entite idea changes..
i feel this solution is not efficient/more confusing. Is there any better ways to solve this?
As always,thanks for reading :)
